# Python Mini Game

This is a simple Python game built as a first programming project. It was created by following a beginner tutorial and adapting the code as I learned.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run the game file using: `python main.py` 

## What I Learned
- Python basics (modules, classes, functions, loops)
- Game logic structure
- Handling user input
- Debugging and testing
